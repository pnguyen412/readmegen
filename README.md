# readmegen

## Description
- The main objective of this challenge was to create a README generator SO THAT users can quickly create a professional README for a new project.
- In addition to the above, we were tasked with ensuring that users were prompted for information about their application repository, a high-quality, professional README.md is generated with the title of my project and sections entitled Description, Installation, Usage, License, Credits, and Questions
- I used module.exports to be able to use the methods in generateMarkdown.js in my index.js.
- I learned how to use exports and make them call to the relevant information in the index.js and was able to print the desired content.


## Installation:
- Clone the repository on github locally. After being successfully cloned, files are editable through VSC.
- This application uses the fs & inquirer modules for node.js

## Usage:
- https://drive.google.com/file/d/1qmQy9_mirlLvI7sibdK6_9lISYPdMWVY/view
